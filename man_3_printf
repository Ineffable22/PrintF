The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any, gives the 
minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, 
it is padded on the left with zeros.  The default precision is 1.  When 0 is printed with 
an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

(ell) A following integer conversion corresponds to a long or unsigned long argument, 
or a following n conversion corresponds to a pointer to a long argument, or a following 
c conversion corresponds to a wint_t argument, or a following s conversion corresponds 
to a pointer to wchar_t argument.
.It S
If no l modifier is present: the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an 
array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up 
to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more 
than the number specified are written.  If a precision is given, no null byte need be present; 
if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must 
contain a terminating null byte.
